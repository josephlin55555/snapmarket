## Description
***Create a market for your used goods with in a snap.***  
SnapMarket is an easy way to take pictures of your things and sell them on an online marketplace.

## Context
Everyone has things they want to sell but creating individual posts for multiple items is a tedious process. SnapMarket allows you to quickly take a single picture of your things and tag every item that is up for sale.

Buyers can also easily search a canvas of listings by tag, make offers for multiple items on a single posting, and coordinate with the seller on pickup and other details.

## How It Works
SnapMarket really shines when it comes to selling your things - simply navigate to the Sell tab and take a quick picture with your phone. If it looks good, tap each individual item that's for sale, tag it, and finally add the price with any other information about the item. Once finished, the listing is posted on the marketplace for anyone to search through.

Buying on SnapMarket is as simple as typing what you want in the search bar and making an offer for any item in a particular listing. If the seller accepts your offer, you will be notified and allowed to chat directly with them and finalize the details.
